# All2D_Base
my very old 2D Graphic Engine All2D complete with GUI and mouse support, event and sprite system

rewritten to use SFML as base

modified to provide a small base application for drawing on a surface..

Supports only standard Events: 

\<ESC> or \<F12> for exit

\<F> for toggling  fullscreen
