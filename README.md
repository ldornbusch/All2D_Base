# All2D_Base
my very old 2D Graphic Engine All2D complete with GUI and mouse support, event and sprite system

rewritten to use SFML as base and therefore usable in Windows and Linux

modified to provide a small base application for drawing on a surface..

The example programm supports only standard Events: 

\<ESC> or \<F12> for exit

\<F> for toggling  fullscreen


This static library is the main dependency for two game-projects:
* [columns](https://github.com/ldornbusch/columns_sfml)
* [hexxagon](https://github.com/ldornbusch/hexxagon_sfml)
